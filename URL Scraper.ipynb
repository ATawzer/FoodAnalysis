If you are using the black beans, place 6 or 7 beans on top of the batter in each cup (the weight of the beans will cause them to sink).\\nPlace the filled cups in a flat-bottomed, lidded steamer fitted with a cloth-protected lid. Set the steamer over high heat. Once you hear the water boiling, adjust the heat to maintain a steady flow of steam. Steam for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the tops of the muffins crack and split and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Always remove the lid carefully to avoid the steam burning your hand.\\nTransfer the muffins to a rack to cool. Keep the paper or foil liners in place until ready to eat. The muffins will keep at room temperature for up to 6 hours; to keep them soft and moist, place them in a closed container or slip them into a resealable bag. To store longer, refrigerate for up to 2 days. To rewarm before serving, place the muffins in a microwave (remove foil liners first) and zap on high for 10 seconds.',\n",

Add the whole-wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour, stirring until the dough starts to pull away from the side of the bowl.\\n3. Using the 3 to 4 tablespoons of bread flour, lightly flour a flat surface. Turn out the dough. Knead for 6 to 7 minutes, gradually adding, if needed, enough of the remaining 1/2 cup bread flour to make the dough smooth and elastic. (The dough shouldn't be dry or stick to the surface. You may not need any of the additional 1/2 cup bread flour, or you may need the entire amount if the dough is too sticky.)\\n4. Using cooking spray, lightly spray a large bowl and a piece of plastic wrap large enough to cover the top of the bowl. Transfer the dough to the bowl, turning to coat all sides with the cooking spray. Cover the bowl with the plastic wrap with the sprayed side down. Let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place (about 85°F) for about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.\\n5. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with cooking parchment. Set aside.\\n6. Punch the dough down. Divide it into 12 equal pieces. Using a small amount of bread flour, lightly flour a flat surface. Roll each piece of dough into an 18-inch rope. Working with one rope, at a point about 4 inches from each end, cross one end of the rope over the other to form a circle with two 4-inch-long tails. Bring the tails together and twist them once. Lift the twist, folding the dough to the opposite side of the circle so that the tails slightly overlap the circle, giving it the shape of a pretzel. Place the pretzel on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough ropes, spacing the pretzels 1 inch apart. Set aside.\\n7. In a small bowl, using a fork, beat the egg yolk and water together. Set aside.\\n8. In a separate small bowl, stir together the ingredients for either topping.\\n9. Brush the yolk mixture over the top of the pretzels. Sprinkle the pretzels with the topping.\\n10. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve hot. Transfer leftovers to a cooling rack. Let cool completely, about 1 hour.\\n11. Store in an airtight container for up to three days. To reheat, microwave on 100 percent power (high) for 20 seconds.\",\n",

Rinse them under cold water, drain, and return them to the pot. Toss the noodles with the sesame seeds and toasted sesame oil. Set aside.\\nMeanwhile, to make the dipping sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, vinegar, tamari, honey, lime juice, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes until well combined. If the sauce is too thick for dipping, stir in a little more lime juice. Set aside.\\nTo prepare the spring rolls: Run a julienne peeler or vegetable peeler down the length of the carrot and cucumber(s) repeatedly, turning halfway, to create long “noodles.” Toss the carrot and cucumber noodles with the soba noodles.\\nFill a shallow pan larger than your rice papers (a pie pan works great) with warm water. Fold a lint-free tea towel in half and place it next to the dish. Make sure your prepared fillings are within reach.\\nPlace one rice paper in the water and let it rest for about 20 seconds. You’ll learn to go by feel here—wait until the sheet is pliable but not super floppy. Carefully lay it flat on the towel.\\nLeaving about 1 inch of open rice paper around the edges, cover the lower third of the paper with a handful of soba, carrot, and cucumber noodles. Top with a few strips of jalapeño and avocado in a row on top of the noodles, then sprinkle with green onions and chopped cilantro.\\nFold the lower edge over the fillings, then fold over the short sides like you would to make a burrito. Lastly, roll it up, stretching the remaining long side around the roll to seal it. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Halve the rolls on the diagonal with a sharp chef’s knife (or serve whole) with the peanut dipping sauce on the side. If you have any peanut sauce left over, it makes a great veggie dip.',\n",

Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring and shaking pan occasionally, until onion is dark brown around the edges, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic is just barely golden, about 1 minute. Add turmeric and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add herbs and spinach (no need to defrost or drain) and cook, stirring often, until herbs are wilted and spinach is thoroughly defrosted, about 2 minutes. Add dried cilantro, pepper, 2½ tsp. salt, and reserved parcooked rice along with all of the water. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook over medium-low heat until flavors come together, about 10 minutes.\\nRemove lid and continue to cook spinach mixture until greens are glossy and liquid is almost completely evaporated (dragging a rubber spatula or wooden spoon through the mixture should leave a trail with little to no liquid seeping back in), 6–8 minutes. Stir in lime juice; taste and season with more salt if needed.\\nMake 6 divots in mixture and crack an egg into each one (or, if making with egg whites only, separate out egg yolks first and reserve for another use). Working quickly, drag the tip of an offset spatula or butter knife through each egg once or twice to break up the yolks and encourage wisps of egg white to spread throughout the mixture (you want a marbled effect—don’t scramble). Cover pan and simmer until eggs are cooked to your liking, about 3 minutes for jammy. Serve with rice and smoked fish alongside if desired.',\n",

       "  'instructions': 'Sauce  --  Make the avocado sauce ahead of time and set in the refrigerator to chill.  I like to use my mini food processor for this, or a blender will work fine.  Add the avocado, milk, lime juice, sour cream, jalapeno and cilantro.  Blend until smooth.  Check for seasoning salt and pepper and adjust as needed. Remove to a small bowl and cover and chill until ready to serve. This sauce is serve cold.\\nChicken  --  Remove to the counter, along with the salsa and eggs.  You want them to be room temp or at least have the chill taken off them.\\nTortilla Chips  --  Add the tortillas to the food processor and grind until fine chopped.  The finer chopped the easier it is. A rough chop or hand chop will not work.\\nDredging Stations  --  1: Flour, salt and pepper.  2: Eggs, lightly beaten  mixed with salsa.  3: Ground tortilla chips.\\nCheese  --  Cut a thin slice about 1/2 of the way through one side of the chicken breast (making a pocket) as you will be stuffing it with the cheese.  Make sure not to cut all the way through to the other side. But make a nice slice so you can stuff it with a fair amount of cheese. About 2 tablespoons per chicken breast. Stuff the chicken breast and secure with a single toothpick.\\nChicken  --  Dredge the chicken in the flour and make sure to shake off any extra. Next, dip in the egg and salsa mix and last into the tortilla chips.\\nSaute  --  In a large NON STICK pan (I prefer non stick for this, but one that is oven proof) and heat to medium high heat.  Add enough oil to just lightly cover the bottom of the pan.  Saute on each side until golden brown. I transfer the pan (if oven proof) to the oven, if not, transfer to a pie plate and finish cooking in a 400 degree oven until the juices run clear. Approximately 10 minutes. It really depends on the thickness of your chicken.\\nServe  --  Garnish the chicken with the avocado sauce, some beans, rice, anything you want.  The avocado sauce is really good with this. Even serve this over some crisp romaine, onion and black beans and use the avocado sauce as the dressing.  You can really serve it lots of way.\\nENJOY!',\n",

I then added red pepper seeds until I got the heat up to our desired level.  I cooked the squash for 35 minutes.  Everything else was per the recipe and my family loved it.  I think the key is tasting and getting the vinaigrette with the right amount of salt, lime and heat.  Also, I used course ground kosher salt to salt the squash prior to baking. Don\\'t skimp on the salt.  The dish was excellent.  mr_eberhart from Concord, CA',\n",

Perhaps I didn't roast the swuash long enough (did 35 mins), but the sweetness was overpowered by the vinaigrette. I think the vinaigrette is AMAZING - but on something else, like fish or chicken. The finished product looks beautiful, and I am a huge cilantro lover, but sadly not a fan of this recipe.

I think next time moisten the steak with the lime and oil and then do a dry rub of curry powder instead of mixing all the ingredients together to see if this would enhance the flavor.

Spoon crust into 9-inch (22.5-cm) pie pan.\\nUsing your fingers, press crumbs evenly into bottom and up sides of pie pan. Press along edge between bottom and side of pan so crust won’t be too thick.\\nBake 8 to 10 minutes until lightly browned and crust gives a little when touched lightly. Cool completely on wire cooling rack. This usually takes about 1 hour.\\nTo Make the Filling:\\nPlace chocolate and butter in a medium bowl set over, not in, simmering water until chocolate melts; or use a double boiler. Remove from heat. The last little lumps will melt as the mixture sits. Cool to room temperature. Reserve.\\nBeat cream cheese in bowl of a heavy-duty mixer on Medium speed until soft and creamy. Scrape down sides of bowl, and add powdered sugar and vanilla. Continue beating on High speed until smooth.\\nGradually add whipping cream and continue beating until soft peaks form. Scrape down sides of bowl. Reduce mixer to Low speed and slowly beat in the melted chocolate. Continue beating until mixture stiffens slightly.\\nSpoon filling into cooled crust. Smooth top and garnish with pecan halves. Chill several hours or freeze until serving. Spoon a little caramel sauce onto serving places and top with pie.\\nBaker’s Note: If the pie is frozen, remove it from the freezer and plate it in refrigerator for several hours before serving. It can be cut and served while frozen, but I prefer to serve it with the filling softened.\\nSecret to success: Toast the pecan halves by placing in a 350°F (180°C) oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Cool before placing on the pie.',\n",

       "  'instructions': 'Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit for the traditional stovetop method, or 350 degrees for the baked methods (casserole or mini/muffins).\\nCrack the eggs into a medium mixing bowl. Add your dairy of choice and the salt. Whisk just until the egg yolks and whites are blended. Whisk in all or half of the cheese (you can reserve the other half for topping the frittata before baking, if desired). Set the mixture aside.\\nIn a 12-inch cast iron skillet (or any other large skillet that’s oven safe), warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the vegetables, starting with chopped onions or other dense vegetables. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, then add any softer vegetables such as zucchini. Cook until those vegetables are tender, then add any garlic or greens, and cook until fragrant or wilted. Season with salt, to taste.\\nTraditional stovetop option: Whisk the eggs once more and pour the mixture over the vegetables. Stir with a spatula briefly to combine and distribute the mixture evenly across the pan. If you reserved any cheese, sprinkle it on top of the frittata now.\\nOnce the outside edge of the frittata turns lighter in color (about 30 seconds to 1 minute), carefully transfer the frittata to the oven. Bake for 7 to 14 minutes (keep an eye on it), until the eggs are puffed and appear cooked, and the center of the frittata jiggles just a bit when you give it a gentle shimmy. Remove the frittata from the oven and place it on a cooling rack to cool. Garnish with herbs, slice with a sharp knife, and serve.\\nBaked casserole option: Let the cooked vegetables cool for a few minutes, then stir them into the egg mixture. Grease a 9 by 13″ pan, then pour the mixture into the pan. If you reserved any cheese, sprinkle it on top of the frittata now.\\nBake for 20 to 25 minutes (keep an eye on it), until the eggs are puffed and appear cooked, and the center of the frittata jiggles just a bit when you give it a gentle shimmy. Remove the frittata from the oven and place it on a cooling rack to cool. Garnish with herbs, slice with a sharp knife, and serve.\\nBaked mini frittata option: Let the cooked vegetables cool for a few minutes, then stir them into the egg mixture. Grease 18 muffin cups (I used two muffin pans for this), then fill the cups evenly with a scant ⅓ cup of the mixture. If you reserved any cheese, sprinkle it on top of the frittatas now.\\nBake for 13 to 17 minutes, until the eggs are puffed and appear cooked, and the center of the frittatas jiggle just a bit when you give the pan a gentle shimmy (this happens quickly so keep an eye on them; my pan with only 6 muffins finished sooner). Remove the pans from the oven and place them on a cooling rack to cool. Garnish with herbs, and serve.',\n",

       "  'instructions': \"1. Place the flour in a medium bowl and make a well. Add the water and the salt and mix, then gradually mix in the flour. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it until it is slightly elastic and smooth, about 5 minutes. Cover it with a bowl and let it sit. The noodle dough can be prepared up to 2 hours before making the soup.\\n2. To make the soup, place the oil, onions and garlic in a large stockpot over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the ginger, the carrots, and the radish and stir, then add the tomatoes and stir. Cook, stirring, until the tomatoes have lost their shape, about 8 minutes.\\n3. Drain the mushrooms, saving the liquid they soaked in, and cut them in quarters. Add the black beans, or the black bean puree to the vegetables in the stock pot, stir, then add the water and the mushroom soaking liquid. Stir, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so the liquid is simmering and cook until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes. Add the spinach and the lettuces. You may need to add the greens gradually, pushing them down into the liquid as they wilt. Cook until all the greens are wilted.\\n4. While the greens are cooking, divide the noodle dough in quarters. Roll the quarters into 1-inch thick ropes, then take one rope and holding it at the end between your thumbs and forefingers, gradually move along the rope of dough as you continue to pinch the dough with your fingers, so that you end up with a band of dough that is about 2-inches wide. Repeat the process on the same band of dough, then repeat with all the ropes of dough so that you have four, flat bands. They will be irregular, but that is fine. When the greens are thoroughly cooked, tear 1-inch pieces off the first band of dough and throw them into the soup. Stir, then continue with the remaining band of dough. The dough is fairly soft, but it tears quite well, resulting in noodles that are irregularly shaped, just as Kunkhen's were.\\n5. Cook the noodles just until they are tender, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring the soup so they cook evenly. Serve the soup immediately, with the garnishes alongside.\",\n",

Cover with a piece of parchment paper and a double thickness of heavy-duty aluminum foil, shiny side down. Seal tightly, and put in the center of the preheated oven to cook for 1½ hours, or until a paring knife pierces the meat easily.

The top of the water will bubble and it will smell very yeasty, this is what you want.\\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and the salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Using a fork gradually stir the flour into the yeast/water mix. Once most of the flour has combined, turn the dough out to a smooth clean work surface and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency.\\nReturn the dough to the mixing bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place for at least 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.\\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F and preheat grill to medium-high heat.\\nIn a small bowl, mix together the tomatoes, olives, capers, red pepper flakes and season with salt and a drizzle of olive oil, set aside.\\nBrush and oil grill to remove any crud and clean.\\nPortion the dough into golf ball size rounds. Using a rolling pin, roll each dough into a rectangle, I like irregular shapes. If not using the dough right away, wrap each 1 in plastic wrap and reserve until ready to use. If using the dough right away grill each dough on both sides so there are grill marks and the dough is stiff and crisp. Top some of the dough with shaved Parmigiano and the other with Taleggio.\\nTop the Taleggio pizzas with the tomato mixture. Place pizzas in oven until cheese melts, about 3 to 4 minutes. Immediately when the Parmesan pizzas come out of the oven, arrange prosciutto slices on top and then top with the arugula and drizzle with spicy chile oil.

I thought the flavor was amazing and perfect as a base for all the toppings.  I have fresh oregano in my yard and I chopped some of that as a topping and it complimented the soup very nicely.  I am too clumsy to have spattering grease around me so I put the oil into the chili mixture and just made a reduction paste by using a large sauté pan and turning the burner on high and then reducing the temp to very low and letting it cook until thick.  Probably there is an amazing taste I'm missing there but next time I make it maybe I can have a friend help with that part.  I will be doing this again and again.

Add duck breasts, skin sides down, and sear, without turning, until skin is deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.\\nUsing tongs, transfer duck breasts, skin sides up, to center of rack in wok, arranging them 1 inch apart. Heat wok, uncovered, over high heat, until steady wisps of smoke begin to appear, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to moderate, then cover wok and, using oven mitts, fold overhang from wok and lid together, crimping to seal tightly (foil will be very hot). Smoke duck breasts, covered, 8 minutes, then remove wok from heat and let stand, covered, 10 minutes for medium-rare to medium. Carefully unwrap foil (smoke and steam will billow out) and transfer duck to a cutting board. Let stand, loosely covered with foil, 10 minutes. Cut each duck breast across the grain into thin slices. Serve duck warm or at room temperature.',\n",

I don't have the nerve to put salad plates under the broiler. I just make it on a half sheet pan. This is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe, Joshua!charroa from V\",\n",

       "  'reviews': [{'review_text': 'Despite baking many, many pies over the years, I had never made a blueberry pie.  I usually do triple berry (w/ raspberry and blackberry), but I decided that straight blueberry is actually better, so I elected to make this for the Fourth of July.  I was making a 10\" pie and I like to have leftover dough anyway so I have room for error when rolling it out-- so I one-and-a-halved the crust recipe.    I used a bit more butter vs. crisco than the recipe called for, probably 1/2 each.  Also used some vodka in place of ice water as we do these days.  I ended up with a small disc of extra dough, which I froze for later use.  For the filling, I was using a thawed 3lb bag of frozen berries, so I reduced the liquid on the stove before returning it to the berries and proceeding with adding the dries.  I feel this step is helpful when using frozen berries.  I am not one for measuring dries when making a berry pie, but I did at least loosely follow the recipe.  I did sub some confectioners sugar in for granulated because I find it\\'s a good way to sneak in some corn starch to help the filling firm up.  I didn\\'t have cream so I used a little whole milk to brush the top crust.  I did that mid-way through cooking, and then again toward the end, when I also added coarse sugar topping (technically sprinkles but really just sugar) to make it look even prettier.  I\\'m writing this review mostly for my own benefit so I can look it up later and repeat everything I did, because it came out perfectly.  Well, actually, the pan could have fit some more blueberry mixture.  3lbs in a 10\" pan makes a flat pie, so if you want convex, go with 4lbs.   I served with Haagen Daz vanilla, of course. meljake from Arlington, VA',\n",

Here's what I did: I used my own recipe for crust (2 1/4 c flour, 1/2 t salt, 1/4 c butter, 1/2 c shortening, 6-7 T cold water, chill for half an hour.) For the filling I used double the amount of vanilla and 1/2 t cinnamon, the juice and zest of one SMALL lemon (about 1/2 t), a big pinch of SALT and 2 T cornstarch (crucial to the setting of the filling). Because of the other reviews, I watched the baking time carefully. After half an hour I covered the edge of the crust with foil and decreased the oven temp to 375. The timing of the recipe was accurate--90 mintues in all. My filling was set, my crust was flakey and golden brown. Rave reviews all around. If you make this pie, be sure your oven rack is adjusted to the bottom quarter to third and the temperature is accurate. Good Luck!A Cook from Urbana-Champaign, IL\",\n",

Along with the onion and garlic, I roasted all the whole tomatoes from a 35 oz. can instead of fresh (they took not nearly as long as the recipe predicted to get charred), and I used three pre-roasted jarred red peppers. After roasting, I pureed all the vegetables and fruits in the blender along with the thyme, some black pepper, a few leaves of fresh basil, 1 1/2 c. homemade chicken stock and maybe 3/4 c. of the thick juice from the canned tomatoes. And that was it. Seriously superb -- when I tasted it from the blender, I said aloud to myself, \"Christ, is that good!\" I recommend topping the soup with croutons (I had leftovers from some I\\'d made the other day) and a little feta or pesto.

But in retrospect, I realize there was probably a reason that the recipe states using water to thin the soup: because with a full 2 cups of chicken stock, it dilutes and masks some of the wonderful, smoky, roasted flavor of the vegetables. Next time, I will use half water and half stock. Second, I used goat cheese as suggested and it tasted great. Third, I agree that you need to fully roast the vegetables so they are charred. Fourth, I put in an extra red pepper as suggested (highly recommended if the tomatoes aren't in season). Fifth, I removed the seeds and loose pulp from the tomatoes before roasting. Sixth, we served it hot, which I think is preferable for the flavor and texture of the soup. Seventh, I found the amount of ingredients in the recipe are a bit skimpy to serve 4 people.

       "  'instructions': 'To Make the Meatballs:\\nLine a large baking sheet or platter with waxed paper. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs and milk and let sit for 5 minutes. Squeeze out any excess milk and discard. Put all of the meats in a medium bowl and add the moistened bread crumbs, egg, garlic, cheeses, parsley, salt, and several grindings of pepper. Mix everything together with your hands or a wooden spoon. Dampen your hands with cold water, pinch off a small piece (about 2 teaspoons) of the meatball mixture, and roll it into a ball. Place it on the prepared baking sheet. Continue to form the meatballs until you have used all the mixture. Keep your hands moistened with cold water to prevent the mixture from sticking to them. You should end up with about 45 meatballs.\\nPour enough vegetable oil into a large skillet or sauté pan to reach a ¼-inch depth. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and heat it to 375°F. To test, pinch off a tiny piece of meatball mixture and drop it into the hot oil. It should sizzle upon hitting the oil. Carefully lower 8 to 10 meatballs into the oil, taking care not to crowd the skillet. Fry them for about 2 minutes, until golden brown on the bottom. Gently roll them over with a fork and fry for another 2 minutes. Use a large slotted spoon or a skimmer to remove the meatballs to a paper-towel-lined platter or a large brown paper bag placed near the stove. Continue to fry the meatballs until you have fried them all.\\nTo assemble and bake the Timballo:\\nHeat the oven to 375°F.\\nBring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until it is very al dente; that is, slightly underdone. Drain the pasta in a colander placed in the sink and transfer the pasta to a large bowl. Toss the pasta with 1 quart (4 cups) of the ragù, This may seem like a lot of sauce, but the pasta and other ingredients will absorb it while the timballo bakes. Add the reserved meatballs, the hard-boiled eggs, and the cheeses. Fold everything together. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\\nDivide the pastry dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Rewrap the smaller piece and set aside. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the larger piece into a disk large enough to cover the bottom and sides of a 10-by-3-inch round springform pan with some overhang. Trim the overhang to about ¾ inch. The dough should be about 1/8 inch thick. Place your rolling pin on the edge of the dough closest to you and gently wrap the dough around the rolling pin. Lift the dough over the pan and carefully unroll it, gently pressing it into the pan. Spoon half of the pasta filling into the pastry-lined pan. Spread 1 cup of the remaining ragù over the filling. Spoon the remaining filling on top of the sauce, pressing down gently to pack in the filling. Top with the remaining cup of sauce.\\nRoll the smaller portion of the pastry dough into a disk large enough to cover the top of the timballo with a little overhang. Place your rolling pin on the edge of the dough closest to you and gently wrap the dough around the rolling pin. Lift the dough over the pan and carefully unroll it to cover the filling. Gently press the overhanging edges of the top and bottom crusts together. Use a little water to moisten the dough to help seal it if necessary. Using your fingers, roll the crust in toward the pan to create a rolled seam. Continue to roll along the circumference of the pan until you have fully sealed the crust.\\nBrush the top of the torte with the egg wash. With a sharp paring knife, cut three 2-inch slits across the top of the timballo.\\nBake the timballo for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Remove the timballo from the oven and let it cool on a rack for 10 minutes. Remove the springform ring from around the timballo. Slide an angled metal spatula between the bottom of the timballo and the bottom of the cake pan to loosen it. Gently slide the timballo onto a large serving platter and bring it to the table. Use a large serrated knife to cut the timballo into wedges.',\n",

I had frozen chicken breasts from Costco, so I simmered them in chicken stock while I prepared the onions and peppers. I added the garlic to the vegetables, sautéing them together. I halved the chicken breasts after about 10 minutes so they would cook through the centers. When they were barely cooked through, I removed them from the pan. I added the lime juice to the chicken stock, along with seasonings (chili powder, more fresh garlic, etc) and then I reduced it to a glaze. I sliced the chicken and then tossed it in the glaze.

What I did was boiled full boneless chicken breasts (about 10-20 min, depending on how thick the breasts were) In the mean time I sauteed the peppers, onions and garlic. After the chicken is done, I shred it by hand, pealing piece by piece. After the chicken is fully shredded I put it in the pan with the vegetables. I put about 1/4 cup of low-sodium reduced fat chicken stock in the pan with the chicken and vegetables, I let it cook down a bit, but still have plenty of juice left so I can make a rue sauce using some of the extra juice in the pan. I take some of the juice out of the pan and a little bit of flour mix it up to make it thick instead of watery, (by doing this it holds in the flavor and you aren't eating a watered down fajita.) After mixing the flour and the extra juice I'm ready to throw it back in the pan and mix it around. Don't let it cook to much longer, it should be close to ready at this point, also you might have to play around with the juice and flour, don't be afraid to experiment.\\nWhile it is cooking I add cumin spice to the mix, as well as chopped habanero peppers.

To amplify the chipotle flavor in the mayo, I also added several generous spoonfuls of the adobo sauce from the canned chipotles, which I think was a clear improvement.

       "  'instructions': \"For the dough: Sprinkle the yeast over 1 1/2 cups warm (not lukewarm) water in a bowl. Let stand for a few minutes.\\nIn a mixer with a paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. With the mixer running on low speed, drizzle in the olive oil and mix until combined. Next, pour in the yeast/water mixture, add the pressed garlic and mix until just combined and the dough comes together in a sticky mass. Divide the dough into 2 balls and put each one in a separate ziptop bag. Set the dough aside for 1 to 2 hours, or store in the fridge until you need it.\\nFor the chicken: Heat the olive oil in a heavy pot over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and sear it on both sides until the skin is golden brown. Remove the chicken from the pot and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the grease.\\nAdd the onions and cook until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Pour in the barbecue sauce and return the chicken to the pot. Cover and cook over medium-low heat until the chicken is falling off the bone, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside until cool enough to handle.\\nWhen cool, use 2 forks to shred the meat from the bones, discarding the skin and bones. Skim off the excess fat from the top of the sauce and reserve.\\nFor the slaw: While the chicken is cooking, combine the shredded cabbage and sliced jalapeno in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the milk, mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, cayenne and salt. Pour the dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate.\\nFor the pizza: When you are ready to make the pizza, preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. Oil a baking sheet or pizza pan with olive oil.\\nGrab one of the balls of pizza dough (the recipe makes 2 crusts, so you can refrigerate or freeze the other ball of dough for another recipe) and squeeze the dough toward the bottom to form a nice, tight, pulled ball. You can roll out the pizza with a rolling pin if you'd like, but sometimes it's just as easy to throw it around and pull and stretch until it feels right.\\nWhen the crust is nice and thin, lay it on the oiled baking sheet. Drizzle a little olive oil on the dough and spread it with your fingers. Very lightly sprinkle some salt on top. Spread the reserved barbecue sauce and onion mixture over the crust, then cover with the mozzarella slices followed by the shredded chicken. Bake on the bottom rack until the crust is golden brown and the toppings are bubbly, 12 to 15 minutes.\\nStir the cilantro into the slaw. Top the pizza with the slaw, cut into pieces and serve.\",\n",

In a separate mixing bowl, use a fork to beat the eggs. Mix the milk and chives into the eggs. Pour the seasoned flour into the beaten egg mixture and, using either a batter whisk or a regular whisk, combine the mixture gently but thoroughly. (No dry pockets of flour should remain.) Cover the bowl and let it sit out at room temperature until your roast leaves the oven.\\nWhen the meat comes out of the oven, remove it to another tray (or a warmed serving platter) and loosely cover it with aluminum foil. Turn the oven temperature to 450°F. with the rack on the center shelf. Pour all of the drippings into a bowl (a 9-pound roast should yield ½ to 1 cup of drippings). Place a small heatproof bowl on your work surface, and into it place the measured beef drippings and melted butter (if not using drippings, use equal amounts of whole and clarified butter).\\nPlace a 13 × 9-inch glass baking dish in the oven to preheat for 5 minutes. Open the oven and add the mixed fat to the dish and shut the door. Allow the fat to heat for 1 minute. Give the batter a brief stir, then open the oven and pour the prepared batter into the hot dish, using a rubber spatula to scrape out all of it (try to be quick, so the oven doesn’t cool down). Shut the door and bake the custard for 12 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 400°F. and bake for 5 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350°F. and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the pudding is golden, crisp, and puffed around the edges and the center is fully set but not overly dark. Remove the dish from the oven and cut the pudding into 6 to 8 equal rectangles, making sure that each person gets a portion of the crisp rim.

When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat and shred, discarding the bones and fat.\\nFor the gumbo: In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the sausages and cook until the fat has rendered down, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausages from the pan and set aside. Add the bacon fat and, when shimmering, add the onions, celery, bell peppers and Anaheim peppers. Saute, stirring frequently, until the onions are just starting to color, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 2 to 3 minutes more, being careful not to let it burn.

Add artichoke halves and refrigerate approximately 24 hours, turning once half way through marinating time.

Bring to room temperature.\\nWarm artichokes for about one minute in the microwave; brush both sides with olive oil.\\nGrill artichokes 4-5 minutes per side, or according to your grill.

       "   '3 lbs semisweet chocolate chunks'],\n",
       "  'instructions': \"Preheat Oven to 325°F.\\nIn a VERY large mixing bowl or largest bowl of your Stand Mixer, add brown sugar, white sugar, and shortening. Cream together very well.\\nIn another large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set Aside.\\nAdd flour mixture and eggs alternately to the creamed mixture, mix well, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.\\nDissolve baking soda in the 4 tbs of HOT water. Add baking soda mixture and vanilla to dough and mix well.\\nStir in nuts and chocolate chunks.\\nDrop by heaping tablespoonful onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 325° for 15-17 minutes. I get 12 cookies to a standard sized cookie sheet.\\nVARIATIONS/TIPS:\\nNuts: Can use walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, etc. so long as you have a total of 2 lbs. I measure each type of nut used into it's own bowl, see reason below.\\nChocolate Chunks: I seldom use just the chocolate chunks called for in the original recipe. Instead I use a combination of 3 lbs of a variety of baking pieces, and put in separate bowls. Try chocolate chunks, semisweet chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, mini M&M's, vanilla baking chips, chocolate/caramel swirled chips, etc. so long as you have a total of about 3 lbs (about 4 - 12 ounce packages) I have already used a little less than 3 lbs when I just didn't have enough available.\\nFUN TIP:\\nBefore adding the nuts and chocolate to your dough, divide the dough into 2 bowls. Since you have measured out the nuts and chocolate (or variety of baking pieces)into separate bowls, you can now create a variety of cookie dough flavors. Add whatever combination you would like so long as you add approximately equal amounts to each bowl.\\nFOR EXAMPLE: Divide cookie dough into 2 bowls. To first bowl add 1 pound chopped pecans, 1 pound chocolate chunks, and 1/2 pound butterscotch chips. To second bowl add 1 pound chopped walnuts, 1 pound caramel/chocolate swirled chips, and 1/2 pound vanilla baking chips. The possibilities are endless. Have fun with this!\\nWhen I freeze the dough, I do use my food saver machine. I fill the food saver bag with desired amount of dough and flatten out slightly before vacuum sealing. This way the dough lays flat in the freezer to save space, and thaws more quickly. I take the dough out of the freezer and put in the fridge the day before I plan on baking.\",\n",

Simmer until the mixture begins to thicken, 10 to 15 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, make the dumplings: Melt the butter with the jalapeno if using and lime juice in a sauce pot over indirect heat, then let cool.\\nWhisk together the flour, baking powder, celery seeds, salt and lime zest in a large bowl. Mix in the cheese.\\nSlowly pour the melted butter mixture into the cold cream in a small bowl and mix together using a fork. (The butter will bead up as you mix.) Pour the butter-cream mixture into the flour mixture and bring together into a soft dough. Set aside.\\nFinish the chicken and vegetable base: Add the chicken, peas and parsley to the skillet with the vegetables. Move the skillet over indirect heat and scoop the biscuit mixture on top, covering the surface of the pan. Cover the grill and cook until the biscuits are golden brown and cooked through, about 20 minutes.\\n(Alternatively, you can make the sauce and melt the butter mixture on a stovetop, then bake the biscuits in a 375 degrees F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.)',\n",

So, that being said, it was excellent and I found that in my first attempt at this recipe, the spices didn't mix in very well to the cream/egg mixture, so I recommend incorporating the spices into the pumpkin puree first, that way they will be well blended. I also used light brown sugar for the tops.

Add the rice and cook for 4–5 minutes over a medium heat. Taste to test; the rice should be soft on the outside but still hard and firm in the middle. Drain, then rinse with tepid water to stop it cooking any further and set aside.\\nMake a saffron liquid by using a pestle and mortar to grind the saffron strands with a pinch of sugar and then add the boiled water. Leave to steep.\\nDrizzle the eggplant slices with some sunflower oil and season generously with salt. Grill for 10–15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the eggplants are cooked through.\\nMeanwhile, make the rest of your filling. Heat 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil with 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large saucepan and fry the onion for about 10 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic and fry for a further 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms to the pan along with the turmeric, allspice, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.\\nLightly toast the cumin seeds in a small pan for a minute and then crush them with a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder, and add them too. Cook until the mushrooms are soft and then take off the heat.\\nPre-heat the oven to 375°F. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with the yogurt, saffron liquid, 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 teaspoon of pepper. Fold the rice in until it is evenly coated with the yogurt and saffron.\\nRub 1 tablespoon butter over the base and sides of a 10-cup ovenproof glass dish. Spoon half of the rice into the dish and press it down evenly. Add a layer of eggplants and mushrooms and finish with a final layer of rice.\\nDot with the remaining butter, cover the dish tightly with foil, and bake for 1 1/2–2 hours or until the base of the tahcheen is crisp and golden brown.\\nWhen the tahcheen is ready, remove from the oven and leave to cool slightly while you make your topping. Melt the butter in a small frying pan and fry the barberries, pistachios, and sugar for 2 minutes until the sugar has melted and the dried fruit has plumped up.\\nTo serve, run a butter knife around the sides of the tahcheen to separate it from the dish. Place a large board over the top and quickly invert the whole thing. Garnish with a sprinkling of the barberry and pistachio topping.',\n",

Cutting the composed cracker before baking was a little tricky. Here's what I found worked: I used two cookie sheets, preparing one while the other one was baking;  for each cracker I used four layers, not three of phyllo.  Following the rest of the directions about butter and egg whites...I folded each phyllo sheet, using two whole sheets to make four layers on each cookie sheet,  making  a smaller cracker on a cookie sheet, but thereby leaving room to use the pizza cutter (wheel type).  By centering the cracker on the cookie sheet there was plenty of room to cut the cracker without losing the toppings.  In my oven eight and a half minutes was perfect for achieving golden toasty crackers. menavas from Oakland\",\n",

Work until you have what looks like coarse, fresh breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar.\\nAdd the egg yolks to the butter and flour. Mix together until you have a soft dough, then turn out on to a floured board and knead briefly, for just a minute. Shape the dough into a smooth, fat cylinder. Wrap it in greaseproof paper or clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for thirty minutes.\\nPlace the Tatin mould or a frying pan over a moderate heat. (If you will be baking the tart in a cake tin, use a frying pan to make the caramel, otherwise you will damage your tin.) Add the Marsala from the dried fruit, leaving the fruit behind in the bowl, then add the sugar. Bring to the boil and leave to form a thin caramel. If you are using a Tatin mould, remove from the heat. If you are using a cake tin, pour the caramel from the frying pan into the tin.\\nCut the butter into small cubes and scatter it over the caramel. Place the plumped-up figs on the base of the tin in a single layer (neatly or not, as you wish), then scatter over the raisins, pushing them into any gaps.\\nRoll out the pastry a little larger than the Tatin mould or cake tin. With the help of the rolling pin—it is very fragile—lift the pastry into the mould or tin, pressing it gently into place over the figs. Tuck in any overhanging pastry.\\nBake in the preheated oven for about thirty minutes, until the pastry is golden. Remove from the oven and leave to settle for ten to fifteen minutes.

Heat a heavy Dutch oven over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and when it is almost smoking, turn the heat to medium-high, carefully add the brisket, and sear until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the brisket to a platter. Pour off the fat from the Dutch oven and add another 2 tablespoons of oil.

Add half of the apricots and all the parsley, thyme, bay leaves, and tomato paste, and continue to cook 1 minute more.\\nReturn the browned brisket to the Dutch oven and add the reduced wine and 2 quarts stock or broth. If the brisket is not completely covered with liquid, add enough extra stock, broth, or water to cover. Bring the liquid to a simmer. Cover the pot and carefully place it in the oven. Cook until the brisket is fork tender, 2 to 2½ hours. Meanwhile, blanch and peel the onions as instructed in the tips, leaving them whole. Cut the remaining apricots into 1/4-inch strips.\\nIn a small sauté pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat and sauté the pearl onions until lightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the apricot strips and pour in the remaining 1/4 cup stock or broth, stirring and scraping with a wooden spoon to deglaze the pan deposits. Reduce the heat and simmer gently until tender, about 5 minutes. Cover and keep warm.\\nWhen the meat is done, carefully transfer it to a heated platter, cover with aluminum foil, and keep warm. Boil the liquid in the Dutch oven until it thickens and reduces to about 1 quart, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour it through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, taste, and adjust the seasonings if necessary with more salt and pepper.\\nTo serve, use a sharp knife to cut the brisket across the grain into 1/4-inch slices. Arrange the slices on heated serving plates or on a heated platter, spoon half the sauce over it, and garnish with the pearl onions and apricots. Sprinkle with minced parsley and pass the remaining sauce on the side. Serves 8.',\n",

       "  'instructions': 'Place the rice in a medium bowl, add water to cover, and swish the rice with your fingers to remove excess starch. Carefully drain off the water, add fresh water, and swish the rice again; repeat until the water remains clear. Add water to cover and set aside.\\nMelt the sugar in a wide heavy pot (I use a 5-quart Dutch oven) over medium heat and cook until the caramel is light brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the onions and stir to coat. Stir in the baking soda, olive oil, and 1 teaspoon of the salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until a glaze forms on the bottom of the pot, about 8 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons water and stir to deglaze. Repeat the process three more times; after the last addition of water, cook the onions until all of the liquid has evaporated. The onions will be the color of dark toast.\\nAdd the tomato paste and 2 tablespoons water and stir to coat the onions. Add the remaining ½ teaspoon salt, the cumin, pepper, currants, and pine nuts and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to stick to the bottom of the pot. Add ¼ cup of the water and cook, stirring often, until the water has evaporated and you’re left with a brick-red, jammy mixture surrounded by crimson oil.\\nDrain the rice and add it to the pot, along with the remaining water. Cook, stirring often and scraping up any bits sticking to the bottom of the pot, until the water is mostly absorbed. Add ¼ cup more water and stir it into the rice mixture. Taste a bit of the liquid for salt and pepper and add more of either if needed. Bring the liquid to a boil, stir the rice once, and remove from the heat. Cover the pot and set aside until the rice has cooled completely, 1 to 1½ hours; stir the rice two or three times while it’s cooling, replacing the lid each time.\\nFill a bowl large enough to accommodate the mussels with warm water. Add salt, about 1 tablespoon per quart of water, and stir to dissolve. Place the mussels in the water, adding more warm water if needed to keep the water temperature up. After 5 minutes, the mussels should begin to open.\\nHold a mussel firmly in one hand and insert a paring knife between the top and bottom shells at the rounded end. Move the knife around the shell and slice through part of the hinge muscle, just far enough to open the shell about an inch. Try not to cut all the way through, so that the top and bottom shells remain attached. Repeat with the remaining mussels.\\nChoose a wide lidded pan or a pot large enough to accommodate the mussels, ideally in a single layer, or in no more than two or three layers. With a small spoon and/or your fingers, fill a mussel loosely with some of the rice; the filling should come to the edges of the shell, but pack it in loosely to leave room for expansion during steaming. Gently press the shell halves together (they will not close all the way), wipe any rice off the outside of the shell with your fingers, and place the mussel in the pan. Repeat until all of the mussels are stuffed, laying them side by side and stacking them if necessary.\\nAdd about ½ inch water to the pan; do not let the water reach the openings in the mussels’ shells. Bring the water to a boil, then lay a piece of parchment paper over the mussels and weight it down with a heatproof plate. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and steam until the rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Check the water level after 10 minutes and add more if necessary. Remove the pan from the heat, uncover it, and remove the plate. Let the mussels cool completely beneath the parchment paper, 1 to 2 hours, depending on the size of your pan.\\nTransfer the pan to the refrigerator and chill at least 8 hours and preferably overnight. Serve the mussels cold, with lemon wedges.',\n",

Cover and let proof in a warm place until the surface is puffy, about 1 hour.\\nAdd the remaining bread flour, the semolina flour, and the salt. Knead in a stand mixer fitted with dough hook on medium speed, or by hand, until the dough is smooth, springy, and elastic, 4 minutes with the mixer or 10 minutes by hand. Rub the dough lightly with oil, place in a clean bowl, and cover with a cloth. Let the dough rise at warm room temperature until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.\\nPunch down the dough, sinking your fist into it to deflate it, and divide into 4 equal pieces for individual pizzas or leave it whole for a large pizza. Form the dough into smooth ball(s), cover, and let rise again until doubled in volume, 45-60 minutes.\\nPreheat the oven to 450°F. Lightly oil a 16-inch pizza pan or large baking sheet with vegetable oil or scatter with cornmeal.\\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll and stretch out the ball(s) of dough to an even 1/4-inch thickness. If the dough has not relaxed properly, it may spring back as you stretch it; simultaneously spinning and stretching the dough will help. (This may be accomplished flat on a work surface or by spinning and tossing it into the air, then catching the disk on the back of your hands. Avoid tearing the dough or creating very thin patches.) Transfer the dough round to the prepared pan.\\nFor the topping, mix together the olive oil, basil, oregano, garlic, and pepper to taste. Spread this mixture evenly over the pizza dough. Spread evenly with the tomato purée and top with the sliced tomatoes and mozzarella. Scatter the Parmesan over the top.\\nBake until the dough is golden brown and the toppings are very hot, 20-30 minutes for 1 large pizza or 10-12 minutes for individual rounds.

When the oven is fully heated, carefully remove the HOT cast-iron pan from the oven and place it over high heat. Add the butter, let it melt, then quickly add the steak. Don\\'t touch it for the first 3 minutes: you\\'re making a super-\"Maillardy\"-crusty caramelized outside (see sidebar opposite). After 3 minutes, flip and sear the second side for 1 1?2 minutes. Then place the entire skillet in the oven for 4 minutes.\\nTransfer the steak to a cutting board and let it rest while you make the sauce, at least 7 minutes.\\nMake the sauce. In the same (unwashed) cast-iron skillet, now set over medium-high heat, add the shallot and green peppercorns and cook until the shallot is just beginning to color, about 2 minute about 2 minutes. Stand back and carefully pour in the vodka (all that vapor is flammable). Quickly position a grill lighter on the\\nedge of the pan, turn your face away, and ignite. Just look at what you\\' and ignite. Then gently swirl the pan and turn the heat to low, until the fames die out. Add the broth and cream and bring to a simmer, whisking, and cook the sauce until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon (a nappé consistency), about 5 minutes.\\nPLATE IT! On a nice, clean wooden cutting board, slice the rested steak off the bone in one whole piece, and set the bone aside. If it\\'s too red for your liking, put it back in the oven for a few minutes. Slice the steak at angles, against the grain. Honestly, you can\\'t mess this up too badly, because the steak will be so good and tender you\\'ll be using all your restraint to not eat it with your fingers. Once sliced, reposition the slices against the bone, fanning them out a bit.\\nPour the sauce over the meat and eat directly from the board. I rarely get this to a table to sit down and \"enjoy it.\" Pour your wine in advance with your comrade in consumption at your side, and have no shame at eating it in the kitchen. If you are married or in love with a carnivore, this says, \"I\\'m sorry,\" \"I love you,\" and \"I want to share the best things in life with you.\"\\nBREAK IT: Add some strong Dijon to the sauce to beat that meat even more into submission.',\n",

I agree that serving the crab cakes atop mesclun greens with the avocado salad on top would produce an elegant lunch, but I think the greens would need to be dressed first. As for the ratios in the salad recipe, you may need to increase all the other ingredients if your avocados are even the slightest bit larger than \"small\".

       "  'instructions': 'To Make the Broth:\\nTo Make the Broth:\\nPut all of the ingredients except the water and salt into a large stockpot. Add the water, pouring in enough to cover the ingredients by about 2 inches. Bring the broth to a boil over medium-high heat, skimming any foam that forms on the surface with a skimmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently, uncovered, skimming any foam that forms on the surface during the first hour or so of cooking, for 3 to 4 hours, adding salt to taste during the last hour of cooking. The broth is ready when it is reduced by about one-half and has developed a rich, meaty flavor.\\nStrain the broth through a colander lined with damp cheesecloth into a clean container. Discard the solids. (You can save the good, large chunks of chicken meat and large pieces of carrot and celery and refrigerate them. I enjoy them as a cold lunch, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt.)\\nLet the broth cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate until well chilled. Skim off and discard the congealed layer of fat on the surface before reheating. To Make the Egg Ribbons:\\nTo Make the Egg Ribbons:\\nCombine the eggs, milk, parsley, salt, nutmeg, and a little pepper in a bowl and whisk together. Gradually whisk in the flour, taking care to avoid lumps. Cover the batter with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.\\nPlace a 9-inch nonstick skillet or sauté pan (I use a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet) over medium heat and coat the bottom with a film of butter. When the butter is hot, pour in a small ladleful of batter (less than ½ cup) and quickly swirl the pan so that the batter coats the entire bottom, forming a thin pancake. Cook for 30 to 45 seconds, or until just set. Using an offset spatula or pancake turner, flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 20 to 30 seconds, or until set. Transfer the pancake to a plate. Continue making the pancakes until you have used all the batter, taking care to add butter to the pan as needed. Stack the pancakes on the plate as you remove them from the skillet.\\nRoll the pancakes up, one or two at a time, and cut them crosswise into thin ribbons (1/8 to ¼ inch wide). Unravel the ribbons and place them on a plate or in a shallow bowl. Continue to roll and cut the pancakes until you have cut them all. Cover the ribbons with plastic wrap and set aside.\\nIn a saucepan, bring the broth to a boil over medium heat. Add the egg ribbons to the boiling broth and cook for just a few minutes, until the ribbons are heated through. Ladle the soup into 6 shallow rimmed bowls and sprinkle each serving with cheese. Serve immediately.',\n",

       "  'instructions': \"Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line the bottoms of two 9-by-2-inch (23-by-5cm) round cake pans with parchment (baking) paper.\\nSift the flour, baking powder, and salt together onto a sheet of waxed paper; set aside.\\nIn a small bowl, combine the milk and vanilla; set aside.\\nUsing a stand mixer, beat the butter with the paddle on medium speed until creamy. Add sugar and beat until mixture is pale and fluffy. Drizzle in the eggs beating each addition until incorporated before continuing (Stop frequently to let the batter absorb the egg. If the batter begins to look curdled , increase the mixer speed to high and beat until batter looks smooth again). Reduce the speed to medium low and add the dry ingredients in 3 additions alternately with the milk mixture in 2 additions, starting and ending with dry ingredients. Beat just until combined.\\nPour the batter into prepared pans and spread it evenly. Bake until the cakes are puffed and a skewer inserted into the centers comes out clean, 20-25 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack. Run a table knife around the edges of the pans and invert the cakes unto plates.\\nTo make the frosting, chop the chocolate into small pieces and put it in a stainless-steel bowl. Set the bowl in a saucepan over, but not touching, barely simmering water. Heat until the chocolate melts, stirring occasionally. Do not allow any water or steam to come in contact with the chocolate, or it will become stiff and grainy. Or, chop the chocolate in large pieces, place in a microwave-safe dish, and microwave on low for 1 minute. Continue to microwave if necessary, checking every 20 seconds, until the chocolate looks softened, then stir until smooth and liquid.\\nUsing a stand mixer, beat the butter with the paddle on medium speed until it is the consistency of mayonnaise. It should not be melted. Transfer to another bowl and thoroughly wash and dry the mixer bowl.\\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk and 1/4 cup (2 oz./60 g) of the sugar, stirring occasionally, until small bubbles appear along the edge of the pan.\\nUsing the stand mixer, beat the egg yolks and the remaining 1/2 cup (4 oz./100 g) sugar with the whisk on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale and thick, about 3 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and pour in the hot milk mixture in a thin stream. Return the mixture to the saucepan. Thoroughly wash and dry the mixer bowl and whisk.\\nCook over medium heat, whisking constantly until it registers 170°F (77°C) on an instant read thermometer 5-7 minutes. Pour the mixture back into the mixer bowl and heat with the whisk on medium speed until cool, 5-10 minutes. Beat in the melted chocolate. Add the butter in 4 additions, incorporating each addition before adding another.\\nTo frost the cake, put one layer, top side down, on a serving plate (To protect the plate, place paper strips under and along the edges of the bottom layer.). Peel off the parchment paper. Using a straight  frosting spatula, spread evenly with about one third of the buttercream. Invert the other layer, top side down, on the first layer peel off the paper. Refrigerate the cake 30 minutes to firm the frosting; keep the remaining buttercream at room temperature. Spread the buttercream on the top and sides cake (Put the frosting in the center of the top of the cake and smooth it evenly. The frosting will cover the top in a thick layer. Evenly smooth the frosting from the top of the cake down the sides, turning the cake as you work. As you cover the side, hold the spatula almost perpendicular to the top of the cake. Holding the spatula almost horizontal to the cake's top, smooth the top with long strokes. Then run the spatula around the sides, making the frosting as smooth as possible. Using short strokes, remove excess frosting from the edge of the top. Discard the waxed paper strips.).\\nRefrigerate the cake until 30 minutes before serving to set the frosting.\",\n",

Squeeze the leftover membrane into the bowl to collect any juice from the remaining fruit still attached.

Drizzle with the cranberry concord drizzle and serve.\\nCombine the cranberries, grape jam, grape juice, sugar and orange zest in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries are very soft and easily break apart when pushed with a wooden spoon, about 20 minutes. Do not simmer too hard or the sauce may boil over. Let cool, then strain the syrup into a small pitcher.',\n",

Reduce the heat to simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Drain well, plunge into the ice bath and let cool for 2 minutes. Drain well again, separate and lay out on baking sheets lined with paper towels in a single layer. Remove 5 or so of the small or torn leaves and reserve for the bottom of the pan.\\nHeat 1/4 cup of the oil in a medium high-sided saute pan over high heat. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring, until the onion is very soft, about 5 minutes; do not allow it to color. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly, until opaque, about 2 minutes.\\nAdd the stock, currants and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, uncovered and stirring a few times, until the rice absorbs the liquid, about 7 minutes. (The rice will only be par-cooked; it will continue to cook in the leaves.) Spread the rice out on a baking sheet to cool.\\nWhen the rice is cooled, stir in the dill, parsley, green onion, pistachios and lemon zest; taste for seasoning.\\nLay a grape leaf on a work surface shiny-side down. Scoop 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons of the filling (depending on the size of the leaf) in your hand and lightly mold it into a log. Put the rice filling near the stem end of the leaf, fold the stem end over the filling, then fold both sides toward the middle and roll up into a cigar. Continue with the remaining leaves and filling.\\nLay the reserved grape leaves on the bottom of a small Dutch oven (this will keep the dolmades from sticking). Tightly fit the dolmades in the pan in a concentric circle, making several layers if needed. Drizzle some of the remaining lemon juice over each layer. Add enough water or stock to just come halfway up the side of the rolls (do not cover them) and drizzle with the remaining olive oil and a pinch of salt.\\nCut out a round of parchment to fit over the dolmades. Place a plate on top of the parchment and a bowl on top of the plate (to hold the rolls down while cooking). Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, cover the pot and cook (making sure it is simmering and not boiling), until the rice is cooked through, about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes longer.\\nCarefully remove the rolls to a serving dish. Serve warm, at room temperature or cold.',\n",

I had used fillet of sole for the fish but next time I will try it with the orange roughy. It was too bland a fish and needed to have more flavor on its own. I do not cook with salt and I am sure that would have made the dish more satisfying but we all totally, enjoyed it.

Heating the pan or dish is important, as it helps the polenta form a bottom crust.\\nIn a heavy saucepan, whisk together the polenta and water and place over medium heat. Bring slowly to a boil, whisking often to prevent lumps from forming. Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for just a few minutes until smooth. Season with salt and black pepper and carefully pour into the hot prepared skillet or dish.\\nBake the polenta cake until it pulls away from the sides of the pan and is lightly golden, 30 to 40 minutes. The cake will be crisp.\\nWhile the polenta cake is baking, prepare the spicy greens: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the greens, and boil until very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the greens into a colander, pressing firmly on them with the back of a spoon to force out excess moisture. Chop the greens coarsely. In a sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and the greens and cook, stirring, until heated through and coated with the oil, about 5 minutes. Add the vinegar, red pepper flakes, and salt to taste. Remove from the heat.\\nWhen the polenta cake is ready, remove from the oven and invert onto a cutting board. Cut into wedges and divide among individual plates. Top the wedges with the warm greens, again dividing evenly, and scatter the cheese over the top. Serve immediately.\\nVariations:\\nThis versatile polenta cake also can be topped with herbed cream cheese and smoked salmon, with sautéed mushrooms and shaved Parmesan cheese, or with crab, shrimp, or smoked trout salad made with mayonnaise and celery.',\n",

Please, please don't sub in canned jalapenos. You'll add an unnecessary vinegar taste. Plus, you people using cans - think of the chemicals, extra salt you add to an otherwise healthy recipe. If you can't tolerate cream, leave it out or increase corn to thicken. South Americans use very little diary - heavy cheese, cream, etc. is a Norte Americano addition (perversion?). Also: Fresh coriander = fresh cilantro. Coriander = cilantro's root/seeds.  Instead of chicken broth, I start with water. To increase corn flavor and thickening, I add extra cobs I froze after taking corn off them for other recipes. I use white onions when mauis not available. I add fresh lime juice and chopped cilantro on top before serving. Finally, try grilling everything while roasting your poblanos and bell peppers. Grilled onion and corn-on-cob is sweeter and makes nice summer-fall transition. We always eat with warm corn tortillas and homemade tomato salsa (chop together tom, cilantro, little onion, S&P, fresh chile is optional). For a complete meal we add side platter of shredded grilled chicken (sprinkled w/ S&P and lime juice) or sliced grilled steak. Recipe easily DOUBLES or TRIPLES and keeps/freezes for a while. I also use blender stick - have been for years. Consider it a must-have basic kitchen tool.  -- P.S. to Robyn123 with watery soup - you can simmer gently uncovered until liquid reduces and then correct seasonings (this is why I never add S&P until just before serving), double-check liquid quantities next time :)A Cook from from San Diego, CA\",\n",
