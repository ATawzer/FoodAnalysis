2,5f217f5b61c02dddcf3f5992,Large Batch Chocolate Chunk (Chocolate Chip) Cookies (Oamc),36,72 serving(s),"['1 1⁄2 cups brown sugar', '1 1⁄2 cups white sugar', '2 cups shortening (No substitutes)', '7 cups flour', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '2 teaspoons salt', '6 eggs, gently beaten', '2 teaspoons baking soda', '4 tablespoons hot water', '2 teaspoons vanilla extract', '2 lbs walnuts or 2 lbs pecans, chopped', '3 lbs semisweet chocolate chunks']","Preheat Oven to 325°F.
In a VERY large mixing bowl or largest bowl of your Stand Mixer, add brown sugar, white sugar, and shortening. Cream together very well.
In another large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set Aside.
Add flour mixture and eggs alternately to the creamed mixture, mix well, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
Dissolve baking soda in the 4 tbs of HOT water. Add baking soda mixture and vanilla to dough and mix well.
Stir in nuts and chocolate chunks.
Drop by heaping tablespoonful onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 325° for 15-17 minutes. I get 12 cookies to a standard sized cookie sheet.
VARIATIONS/TIPS:
Nuts: Can use walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, etc. so long as you have a total of 2 lbs. I measure each type of nut used into it's own bowl, see reason below.
Chocolate Chunks: I seldom use just the chocolate chunks called for in the original recipe. Instead I use a combination of 3 lbs of a variety of baking pieces, and put in separate bowls. Try chocolate chunks, semisweet chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, mini M&M's, vanilla baking chips, chocolate/caramel swirled chips, etc. so long as you have a total of about 3 lbs (about 4 - 12 ounce packages) I have already used a little less than 3 lbs when I just didn't have enough available.
FUN TIP:
Before adding the nuts and chocolate to your dough, divide the dough into 2 bowls. Since you have measured out the nuts and chocolate (or variety of baking pieces)into separate bowls, you can now create a variety of cookie dough flavors. Add whatever combination you would like so long as you add approximately equal amounts to each bowl.
FOR EXAMPLE: Divide cookie dough into 2 bowls. To first bowl add 1 pound chopped pecans, 1 pound chocolate chunks, and 1/2 pound butterscotch chips. To second bowl add 1 pound chopped walnuts, 1 pound caramel/chocolate swirled chips, and 1/2 pound vanilla baking chips. The possibilities are endless. Have fun with this!
When I freeze the dough, I do use my food saver machine. I fill the food saver bag with desired amount of dough and flatten out slightly before vacuum sealing. This way the dough lays flat in the freezer to save space, and thaws more quickly. I take the dough out of the freezer and put in the fridge the day before I plan on baking.","https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92,fl_progressive,w_1200,c_scale/v1/img/recipes/18/78/79/pic5vPXRn.jpg",5.0,,,food_com,https://www.food.com/recipe/large-batch-chocolate-chunk-chocolate-chip-cookies-oamc-187879,,,,,,,,,,,

I cut the baking powder and didn't whip the cream like suggested and got light, fluffy scones. I had trouble, though, with kneading, shaping, and cutting the dough; it was incredibly soft, sticky, and hard to work with. My advice is, after folding in the cream, just mix it gently in the bowl with a wooden spoon and then drop heaping tablespoonfuls of the dough onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Seventeen minutes was a perfect baking time, I found, and they slid right off the parchment perfectly. They aren't perfect wedges this way, but I yielded about 30 scones that were 2 to 3 inches in diameter; I can't imagine wanting them bigger, and they'll feed more people that way.

Lightly butter a 9x13-inch pan with parchment paper, allowing enough overhang on the long side to lift the bars from the pan.\nPrepare the gooey chocolate filling: Place the chocolate chips and condensed milk in a small saucepan over the lowest possible heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the chocolate has melted and the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, add vanilla, and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature.\nPrepare the cookie dough: Place the butter and sugars in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla. Beat well. Whisk together the flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Add to the butter mixture. Beat until everything is well incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Stir in the chocolate chips.\nPrepare the bars: Using half of the batch of cookie dough, place dollops into the prepared pan and press down lightly to even it out. Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the dough and then add small dollops of the remaining dough on top. Don't worry if the dollops don't completely cover the chocolate mixture. Just spread it together as much as you can, and let some chocolate peek through.\nBake until lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside to cool completely, then cut into 32 bars.\nThese are easiest to cut when they have chilled for a while.

Grease a 9 by 13-inch jelly roll pan with softened butter or cooking spray.\nBeat your butter in the bowl of a stand mixer until it is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the brown and granulated sugars a little bit at a time, pouring them in on the side of the bowl. While you're adding your sugars, stop the mixer occasionally and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure that everything is fully mixed. Cream the butter and sugar mixture until it is light and fluffy, about 8 minutes. (Creaming creates air pockets in the dough, and therefore these blondies have a light and delicate texture.)\nWhisk your flour, baking soda and sea salt, if using, in a bowl. (Add the salt only if desired because there is plenty on top of the finished brownies.) Add your eggs 1 at a time, adding the second only after the first is fully incorporated. Once the second egg is fully incorporated, add your vanilla. Turn your mixer down to low speed and slowly add the flour mixture. Once the dry ingredients are fully incorporated into the wet ingredients, add in all those chocolate chips. Your machine will seem to be struggling to mix in the chocolate chips because there are so many of them, but don't turn it up, leave it on low and allow it to fully mix the chips in. Spread your cookie dough into the prepared jelly roll. Evenly sprinkle the top of the dough with the fleur de sel.\nPop the blondies in the oven until they are golden brown on top and not wobbly in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow the blondies to cool in the pan on a wire rack or on a dishtowel on your counter.\nCut the blondies, still in the pan, with a sharp knife into bars, about 48 pieces. Remove with a spatula and serve.

Place the ball of dough on parchment paper placed on a cookie sheet (or a lightly greased cookie sheet) and smash it down a little so it becomes a 1/2-inch thick disk.

I usually bake these without turning on the convection.)  Cool for 3-4 minutes.\nYou can freeze the dough.  Make the disks of dough (per the above instructions); line them on wax paper or parchment paper (on a cookie sheet).  You can place them close to each other since they will not be going in the oven.

Next time I make them I am going to roll them out as logs, making 3/4"" slits 1"" apart bake it and then finish cutting through the dough after it comes out of the oven as suggested in the ""Rugelach"" recipe on this site... Good Luck and enjoy!!!Ellaine from Astoria, NY', 'rating': 4}, {'review_text': ""These rugelach were delicious and our Hanukah guests agreed -- especially one woman whose father owned a bakery! Definitely watch them after 20 minutes in the oven -- these were perfectly golden brown in about 25. I discovered that if you apply the fillings in a doughnut shaped manner (leaving a small unfilled area in the center of each dough round) the wrapped tips don't ooze as much and look neater. These are bound to become a yearly tradition.mmmpie from Valencia, CA"", 'rating': 3}, {'review_text': ""The whole trick to making this is to use a good quality jam.

Small thing to the cake: after buttering the pans, I used dutch process cocoa to dust, rather than flour. With the frosting, I skipped the mini-chocolate chips and did not fold any chocolate into the frosting. Instead, after frosting each layer, I sprinkled a lavish amount of JUST white chocolate shavings (use a vegetable peeler on room temp chocolate). Then frosted the whole cake and threw a bunch more shavings all over it, some spilling around the edge of the cake and it was gorgeous and scrumptious. The only thing I would modify about that treatment is that the layers did not stay stuck together as reliably as usual, once a slice was cut, b/c of the white shavings. So next time, I\'ll either just use shavings on the final application of frosting, or fold in shavings to some of the frosting, reserved for application to the inner layers of the cake. The frosting itself is very ""mousse-like"", as another reviewer mentioned, and would easily work as a dessert (in a very tiny dish -very rich!) all by itself! I will be using this recipe 20 years from now for family birthdays and any other excuse I can conjure up to make it again and again. Fantastic! p.s. the mini chips or some other tiny candies would make for a great modification for a child\'s bday cake!

The unbaked dough freezes really well, enabling you to store the unbaked scones in your freezer and bake them up fresh when desired. Just cut the dough into wedges, place them on a tray in the freezer for an hour and then transfer the frozen wedges to a plastic freezer bag.

Like many other reviewers here, I only use 1/2 cup chips (or chunks chopped up from my favorite dark chocolate bar), which I think makes for a nice balance of flavors, but chocoholics might want the full 3/4 cup. Same goes with the amount of nuts you use--that's all personal preference (we like lots of pecans). Aside from chips and nuts, I don't understand why some people decrease or increase other ingredients, like the amount of sugar or the mashed bananas, because that messes with the chemistry of the recipe. If you want it to come out moist and perfectly textured, follow the recipe (aside from nuts/chips). If you have leftover banana, eat or toss it, don't ruin your bread! As for oven time, everyone's oven is different so watch it closely the first time you bake it and test with toothpick during the last 15 mins of baking. Then make a note for yourself for next time. For my professional convection oven, 325 for about an hour is perfect.

Set aside.\nCream the butter and incorporate the eggs (see the Notes on creaming butter and room-temperature eggs):\nPlace the butter in the bowl of the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the sugar, and beat on medium-high speed until the mixture becomes fluffy and lighter in color, approximately 5 minutes. Add the dark brown sugar and continue creaming for 3 to 4 minutes, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Turn the mixer down to slow speed. Add the eggs and egg white, one at a time, and continue to beat until they are fully incorporated and the batter looks smooth and glossy, 1 to 2 minutes.\nFinish the dough:\nAdd the dry mixture, all at once, to the butter mixture. Using a rubber spatula, fold together for a few turns. With the mixer on slow speed, mix the dough until thoroughly combined, 1 minute. Add the chopped milk chocolate and the golden raisins. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and mix for another 30 seconds. The dough can be made up to this point and refrigerated, well wrapped, for up to 3 days.\nShape the cookies:\nUsing 2 teaspoons, scoop the dough into mounds and place 2 inches apart on your prepared cookie sheets. Flatten each mound with the back of a spoon or two fingertips.\nBake the cookies:\nBake the cookies until they spread, rise, and turn a light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. For even browning, rotate your cookie sheets from front to back and between each of the baking racks at least once while the cookies are baking. Remove from the oven and let coolon the sheets. Once cooled they will be crispy on the outside and chewy, moist, and buttery in the middle. If you continue to bake the cookies they will color more and your result will be a crunchy, caramelized, and intensely flavorful cookie.\nServing Suggestions:\nThese cookies are delicious all on their own.\nVariation:\nDried Cherry or Dried Pear and Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies: Substitute dried cherries or diced dried pears for the raisins and dark chocolate for the milk chocolate.'",https://irepo.primecp.com/2016/03/268036/recipe-16183_Large500_ID-1514740.jpg?v=1514740,-1,,,cookstr,https://www.cookstr.com/recipes/oatmeal-cookies-with-golden-raisins-and-milk-chocolate-chips,,,,,,,,,,,

(SEE PHOTO).\nAdd butter, cream and 1/8 teaspoon salt and continue swirling until everything is mixed together. Using a spatula continue stirring until completely mixed. Let cool. (SEE PHOTO) Here's a hint when it comes to cleaning the pan of stuck on candy -- rinse out the pan with hot water first. Then add 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup white vinegar and bring to a boil. Let boil for 2-3 minutes. Empty water/vinegar mix and wash normally.

I noticed in one review here that someone actually used wax paper to bake on and they were none to pleased (for obvious reasons). \n\nSo...now that I\'ve gotten that out of the way (heh)...\n\nI REALLY like the potential this recipe possesses after attempting these only once.\n\nI intend on making the following adjustments on the next batch:\n\n* Reducing baking time to 10-12 minutes from 13-15 because the bottoms got a little too done; not by much, but just enough to notice (a bit too hard and almost on the verge of burning)\n\n* Reducing vanilla extract from 1 1/2 tsp to either 1/2 tsp or 1 tsp (I\'ll try both at some point) because I felt that the vanilla competed with the other flavors in the finished product. Personally, I don\'t like things that are too sweet...especially unnecessarily so...but that\'s my palette. Nor do I believe that vanilla extract should stand out as a specific flavor. Besides, I\'d rather taste more of the butter, which is one of my favorite elements in a cookie.\n\n* Reducing chocolate chips from 16 oz to 12 oz (possibly even 10 oz) because it felt really excessive. Plus, it felt like the dough struggled to accommodate the entire pound. Plus, you\'ll need the room in the dough should you decide to add nuts (I would incorporate no more than 3/4 cup) and, if this is the case, I would strongly consider using only 10 oz of chips.\n\n* Using only two eggs thus eliminating the 1 3/4 tbs of the third egg. I feel that this will make the cookie a tad less ""cake-y"". Again, this is based solely on my personal preference toward a slightly more chewy textured cookie.\n\nOver all, I have to say I really like these.

Carefully flip pancakes and cook until browned on the underside (~2 minutes more).\nTransfer cooked pancakes to a baking sheet or plate and keep warm in a 200-degree F (94 C) oven.
